# Predicting Housing Prices in Kings County, Seattle

Authors: Donna Lee

## Overview 

The goal of this project is to find a model that best predicts housing prices in Kings County, Seattle. The model was trained on 17,000+ sales in 2014 and 2015 from the area. I examined the data to understand what variables impacts housing prices and used a regression model to predict the prices of homes sold. 

## Initial Data Investigation

There are some key assumptions everyone holds about the housing market so I decided to start there. Some initial variables I looked at included: 
* *Zip Code*
* *Square Foot Living* 
  - ![sqft_living_and_price](https://github.com/dlee0106/kings_county_housing_prices_prediction/blob/main/sqft_living_and_price.png)
* *Number of Bedrooms*
* *Number of Bathrooms*
* *Selling Season*
* *Renovated (Yes/No)*
